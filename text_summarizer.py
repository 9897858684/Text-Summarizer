# Input text - to summarize 
text = """There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization to keep it simple, I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them.
Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning.
One benefit of this will be, you don’t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project.
It’s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see.
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar. """
